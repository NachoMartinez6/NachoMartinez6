# Hello World! 👋

### About me

🔹 Marine scientist by career, during this I realized that what I liked most was studying the subjects that had **statistics** and where I learned to **analyze data** by using the statistical software R.

🔹 So, upon finishing my degree, I decided to continue learning on my own first and then complete a master's degree in **Big Data and Business Intelligence**, where I was able to deepen my knowledge of programming (**Python**), as well as databases (**SQL**). and BI tools (**PowerBI**).

🔹 Currently, I have been working as a **BI Developer and Data Analyst** for more than a year within the **banking sector**, an experience that has allowed me to improve my skills, as well as learn new tools for both the development of ETL processes (**PowerCenter**) and visualization of the data (**OBIEE**).

🎯 My goal is to continue **developing my skills** in the field of data analysis to be able to serve companies mainly in **Business Intelligence projects**.
